Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is the systematic process of developing and maintaining software systems. This includes processes such as design, development, testing and deployment.

reference- the first class lecture

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 

software engineering is the step by step process of developing a software from assesssing requirements, designing, implementation, all through to maintenance, whereas propgramming is more centered around writing, testing and updating code.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Requirements- This is the process of identifying the problem to be solved by development of software and determining the tools you will need to come up with the software

Design- This is the process of coming up with a potential layout of the software you intend to develop

Implementation- This is writing the code to come up with the software you want to build

Testing- this is the process of assessing the quality of the product created and ensuring that it serves the purpose you intend it to

Deployment- this is the process of distributing the software to the users

Maintenance- this is the process of creating updates and fixing any bugs after deployment

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall model is used when you are following the software development life cycle one step at a time in the specified order whereas in Agile, you may start with a step down the line, for example design, then testing, and changing design based on requirement. it is a more flexible approach

waterfall is best for short term projects and agile is best for longterm projects 

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is a step of the software development life cycle that involves identifying and documenting both user and software requirements 

the process involves elicitation of requirements, specification of requirements, verification and validation, and management of requirements

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity is the process of breaking up a software into several units that are developed and maintained independently, but function together to form a single application

This improves the process of maintenance as changing a code in one of the modules, does not affect or cause bugs in other modules. This also means different people can work on each unit or module independently, without affecting the others. In terms of scalability, this allows developers to scale the modules indepenedntly, as not all modules may require additional resources at the same time. 

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing is whereby each unit is submitted for assessment to determine if it is fully functional

Integration testing is the prpcess of combining the distinct units into a group and the testing it, to see how they run together

System testing is where the complete application is tested to ensure it meets the funtional and technical requirements

Acceptance testing is where the application is tested by users to make sure it is ready for deployment

Testing is important as it enables developers to ensure that the product is of good quality and meets the prespecified requirements before deplorment

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

version control systems are tools that enable software developers and their teams to track modifications made to source code

Git- allows software teams to track changes made to code. It is easy to learn and has fast operation speed.

mercurial- it is efficient for managing projects of all sizes. it peforms well with large codebases

PerForce- is also known for being able to handle large codebases

Subversion- it keeps project files in one place making it easy to track changes

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

 The role of a project manager is to oversee varoius aspects of a project, from planning, design, exection to delivery and ensuring that all these processes run smoothly and within time and budgetary limits

Responsibilities

writing a project proposal
estimation of the project cost
scheduling
ensuring appropriate staff for the the project
anticipating and managing any potential risks that arise
motivating the team
reporting project status to the customer

Challenges
managing diverse teams
resourse contraints
meeting tight deadlines
maintaining good communication with all stakeholders

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the process of identifying any developing problems with the software and making the necessary adjustments and enhancements to ensure that it is running smoothly and properly.

Corrective software maintenance is the process of fixing errrors and faults that impact functionality of the software

Adaptive software maintenace is the rpocess of changing certain componenets of the software to suit evolving environment or users rules or policies

Perfective software maintenance is making changes to your software over time to enhance the user experience

Preeventive software maintenance is the process of making changes to software over time to prevent deterioration and ensure it is up to date.

It is an essential part of the lifecycle as it ensure that the software remains functional, up to date and continues to meet the user requirements seamlessly

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

data Privacy- engineers must inform users before they collect any personal information and the users should be allowed to consent or not to consent. One should not collect more data than is necessary and should not share with third parties without user consent.

Accessibility- Softare should be develope in such a manner that it can be used by all people, including the physically chanllenged with tools such as screen readers and magnifiers

Additive design- Software should be designed to consider the users well being. excessive notifications and endless feeds should be avoided

Algotihmic bias- software should be developed in such a way that it is inclusive of all races and cultures. For example, in AI development, the data used should be diverse and inclusive and reflecting the variety of global users.

Software security- engineers can esnure safety by carrying out safety testing and fixing any potential security lapses before breaches occur.
